# OOP and Python

Object- oriented ptogramming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design with objects and data rather than functions and logic.

An object is referred to as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Everything in OOP is grouped as self-sustainable objects.

it is using for programs that large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

Major Concepts

- Abstraction
    
    Objects only expose internal mechanisms related to the use of other objects and hide unnecessary application code.
    
- Inheritance
    
    Classes can reuse code from other classes. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse common logic while maintaining a unique hierarchy.
    
- Polymorphism
    
    Objects are designed to share behaviors and can take multiple forms. The program reduces the need to duplicate code by determining what meaning or usage is required for each execution of that object from a superclass. A subclass is then created, which extends the functionality of the superclass. Polymorphism allows objects of different types to pass through the same interface.
    
- Encapsulation
    
    This policy states that all important information resides inside an object and only certain information is exposed.
    
    Other objects do not have access to or permission to make changes to this class. They can only call a list of public functions or methods.
    

**Classes:** are user-defined data types that serve as blueprints for individual objects, attributes, and methods.

**Objects:** are instances of a class created with specially defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.

**Methods:** are functions defined within a class that define the behavior of an object.

**Attiributes:** are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object.

The first real world example that comes to mind is automobile.
